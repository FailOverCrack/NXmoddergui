# What does the software at this time?
The only thing that this software will do this time is downloading and extracting the latest Atmosphere ZIP.
# How to use?
If you want to use this program you have to compile it yourself for now.
As soon as you have the program open, simply enter the path to your SD card where the files should be written to. That's it
# Development
I'm looking for developers to help with the project.

Here an little to do list:
1. Add the HB Appstore.
2. an a nicer and easier to use user interface.
3. an implementation to send the fusee.bin to the switch.

Feel free and add your own ideas to the Project

Thankyou
